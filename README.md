# LinkedList
Playground : Detect a cycle in a LinkedList

*Based on HackerRank.com tests*

A linked list is said to contain a cycle if any node is visited more than once while traversing the list.

It has one parameter: a pointer to a Node object named *head* that points to the head of a linked list. 

Your function must return a boolean denoting whether or not there is a cycle in the list.

If there is a cycle, return true; otherwise, return false.

Note: If the list is empty, *head* will be null.

**Output Format**

If the list contains a cycle, your function must return true. If the list does not contain a cycle, it must return false.
